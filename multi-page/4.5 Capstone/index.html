    <h2>LinCODEn Project</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
      <p>
        Basically, LiCODEn will be the only and decisive way for my efforts as a
        developer. It is a functional copy of LinkedIn just to show the real
        level of my skills in a productive market parameter.
      </p>
      <li><h3>Education</h3></li>
      <p>
        Well, I will use this section to clarify the method of learning to
        construct this project. Udemy will be my very first step as a developer.
        But, after the delivery of LinCODEn in your productive web version, all
        other paths to development improvement will be self-taught. Because the
        basics won't be a worry, and the time will. While others are looking at
        me, my update time needs to be consistent.
      </p>
      <li><h3>Work Experience</h3></li>
      <p>
        The LinCODEn Project is the best way to substitute the real experience
        before and after a job opportunity.
      </p>
      <li><h3>Skills</h3></li>
      <p>
        To begin LinCODEn, my proficiency in some programming and development
        tools will be something indispensable. The arsenal is going to be, at least, in the order below:
        <ol>
          <li>HTML ★★★★★</li>
          <li>CSS ★★★★★</li>
          <li>JS ★★★★★</li>
          <li>NODE ★★★★★</li>
          <li>REACT ★★★★★</li>
          <li>MONGODB ★★★★★</li>
          <li>WEB3 ★★★★★</li>
          <li>DAPPS ★★★★★</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <li><h3>Achievements</h3></li>
      <p>
        Being able to install and keep LinCODEn running through maintenance and
        update work will be my biggest medal. Who doesn't want a developer
        capable of taking over a platform like LinkedIn by himself?
